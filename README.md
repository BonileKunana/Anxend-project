## Anxend Interview Mini Project

I couldn't finish the project to the end. I was facing problems with installation of edgedb but I was able to finish the front end.

I also coudn't impliment the features related to security, validation, test responsive and accessibility. but I will just explain how I would impliment them.

Security:
 the nature of the project I choose would security when adding items to the data base, so I wouldn't add items directly to the database. I would write a code in NodeJS, and the NodeJS file would be responsible for adding and retriving items to the database.

Responsiveness:
  to ensure that the site is responsive I would impliment the necessary features to ensure that it appears well in all devices of different sizes

Accessibility:
  to make sure that the site is accessible all the time, I would choose the reliable hosting provider(choose the provider with uptime guarantee of 99.99% for example). Load Balancing this is about distributing the incoming trafic across multiple servers.

Validation:
 I would ensure that the user is aware of the data that is encorrect before the data is even sent to the database(for example email or password is incorrect). There is a need for validation on the server side as well, the data need to be checked if it is on the right format, correct datatypes or value ranges.

Testing:
 I would test functionality, usablity, security and perfomance to ensure that it meets the require standards and have good user experince.
 Functionality ensures that website works as expected(testing buttons, links, etc)
 Usability fucuses on user experience, ensures that the site is intuitive and user friendly 
 Compability ensures that the site works as expected across different devices
